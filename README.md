A mobile application for Beacon GECPKD that aims to simplify and digitalize 
Blood Donation/Request for blood and Donation to Charity/Charity Request. Initially the
application was built for Beacon GECPKD to seamlessly carry out its initiatives. Later on,
other functionalities were added to increase the productivity of the application. I will
be adding in more functionalities as I develop my skills and as new services 
will be required by the application.

The project aims to outline the development of a comprehensive college software application 
with three primary objectives: blood donation, charity donation, and office enquiry handling. 
The application serves as a user-friendly platform to promote social responsibility among 
college communities. Users can actively engage in blood donation drives and charitable 
activities. 

Additionally, the application streamlines office communication and enquiry handling, 
enhancing efficiency. As future work, the platform aims to include request forwarding, 
enabling students to propose and participate in philanthropic initiatives within the college 
community. The project envisions fostering a culture of giving back and inspiring positive 
change through technology-driven solutions.
